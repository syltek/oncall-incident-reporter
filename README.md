## Introduction

A Golang AWS Lambda application that bridges Slack and Datadog's on-call system, allowing teams to trigger incidents directly
from Slack commands. When users invoke a slash command, they're presented with a customizable form to input incident details.
Upon submission, the application creates an error event in Datadog, which can trigger monitors and page on-call teams.

## Features

- üöÄ Slack slash command integration for incident reporting
- üìù Interactive modal forms for incident details (configurable via YAML)
- üîÑ Automatic Datadog error event creation
- üîî Integration with Datadog's on-call system
- üîí Slack signature validation following the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack#validating-a-request)
- üìä Structured logging with sensitive data redaction
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Ready for AWS Lambda deployment
- üìö Documentation and examples for configuration

## How It Works

1. User triggers a slash command in Slack
2. Application presents a customizable modal form
3. User fills incident details
4. Application creates an error event in Datadog
5. Datadog monitor (example provided) detects the event and pages on-call team

## Prerequisites

- Go `1.23` or higher
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) - Task runner/build tool
- Slack Workspace with admin access
- Datadog account with API and Application keys
- AWS account with Lambda and API Gateway access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syltek/oncall-incident-reporter.git
cd oncall-incident-reporter
```

2. Install task

```bash
brew install task
```

3. Copy config example configuration and customize it

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

### Environment Variables

- `SLACK_TOKEN` - Slack Bot User OAuth Token
- `CONFIG_FILE` - Path to configuration file (default: config.yaml)
- `DEBUG` - Enable debug logging (true/false)
- `LOCAL` - Run in local development mode (true/false)

## Deployment

### AWS Lambda Setup

The application is designed to work with AWS Lambda and API Gateway. The handler uses `events.APIGatewayProxyRequest` and
`events.APIGatewayProxyResponse` for seamless integration.

Example Terraform configurations are provided in the [terraform](./terraform) directory, including:
- Lambda function configuration
- API Gateway setup
- Required IAM roles and policies
- Datadog monitor example

### Deploy with Terraform

See [terraform_deployment.md](doc/terraform_deployment.md)

## Usage

### Local Development

Start the application locally with hot reload:

```bash
task start
```

## Architecture

The application is structured into several key packages:

- `cmd/` - Application entry point and main configuration
- `internal/` - Internal application code
  - `clients/` - Creates the external clients (Slack, Datadog).
  - `config/` - Configuration management
  - `handlers/` - Request handlers
  - `middleware/` - HTTP middleware
  - `router/` - HTTP routing
  - `service/` - Application services. Contains the external clients.
  - `slackmodal/` - Slack modal handling
- `pkg/` - Shared packages
  - `errors/` - Error handling
  - `logutil/` - Logging utilities

## Slack Command Setup

For detailed instructions on setting up the Slack command integration, including:
- Creating a Slack App
- Configuring slash commands
- Setting up interactivity endpoints
- Configuring authentication
- Testing the integration

See [Slack Command Setup Guide](doc/example_slack_command.md)
